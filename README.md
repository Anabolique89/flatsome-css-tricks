# Flatsome CSS Tricks and Fixes

Since a couple of months I am not developing Wordpress websites with Flatsome anymore but today, I have decided to put up a document including the CSS tricks and fixes that I used most during the past years as a farewell gift.

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<b>1.</b> I will not be responsible for any broken website, you should be able to read and understand what you are going to paste into your editor before copying any snippet, this document is not intended to people first approaching CSS editing, it just wants to be an incentive to learn CSS from editing basic properties.

<b>2.</b> I do not guarantee that those CSS snippets will work on your website, what I can tell you is that I took them from my Flatsome working websites. Sometimes you can find a note written below the snippet title, explaining which setting in Flatsome's options you will need to set in order to have the snippet working.

<b>3.</b> The snippets basically contain fixes and basic customization for the most important elements like menu, header, columns, slider... To edit the colours you will need to enter your custom color HEX codes (you can pick them from here https://htmlcolorcodes.com/), to edit borders, spacings, font sizes you will need to enter the value in pixels or em.

<b>4.</b> DO NOT COPY PASTE THE ENTIRE TEXT IN YOUR EDITOR, YOU WILL BREAK YOUR DESIGN 100%, I have divided the document in two main sections, the first one "ALL SCREENS" contains all the snippets that I used to paste inside the first field of the CSS editor, then the second one "TABLET AND BELOW" contains all the snippets which will edit the tablet and mobile specific CSS.
